# Following are the groups of accounts of various types
# The configuration is defined in tree-like structure, the names of accounts
# will be built traversing down to the leaves(e.g. Assets:Physical:Cash)
# If the leaf node (can be a dict or str) doesn't have a 'currencies' key, its
# name will be treated as a currency (e.g. Assets:MyFavouriteBank:Savings:GBP)

# booking_method is an optional configuration, see
# https://beancount.github.io/docs/how_inventories_work.html#per-account-booking-method
# it's recommended for the opaque funds or investments where you don't care about 
# specific lots traded explicitly or don't have access to this information
