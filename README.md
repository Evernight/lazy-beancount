# [Lazy Beancount](https://lazy-beancount.xyz/)

This repository contains bootstrapping structure for your own Beancount repository and a Docker config to ease setup.
Check out the full guide here: https://lazy-beancount.xyz/.

# Setup (Docker)

You should have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running.
Clone repository and build the image:

```
    git clone https://github.com/Evernight/lazy-beancount
    cd lazy-beancount

    docker build . -t lazy-beancount
```

Stop previous container (if exists) and run new container:

```
    docker rm lazybean;
    docker run -it \
        -v $PWD/example_data:/workspace \
        -v $PWD/tmp:/home/beancount-user/ \
        -p 5000:5000 \
        -p 8101:8101 \
        --name lazybean \
        lazy-beancount
```

Fava will be available on port 5000, importer interface for importers from [this repository](https://github.com/Evernight/beancount-importers) will be available on port 8101.

Commands are available in container like: 

```
    docker exec -it lazybean bean-price example_data/main.bean -i --date=2024-01-05
```

Change ```example_data``` to ```data``` in docker launch command when you're ready to switch to your own data.

# Setup (local env via conda)

If you want to be able to upgrade individual packages and experiment with other (and your own) plugins, you may go down this route.

First, clone this repository into your desired location

```
    git clone https://github.com/Evernight/lazy-beancount
    cd lazy-beancount
```

Install conda

```
    brew install miniconda
```

Then create and activate the environment

```
    conda create -n lazy-beancount-env python=3.11
    conda activate lazy-beancount-env
```

Install required packages in the environment

```
    pip3 install beancount
    pip3 install fava
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr/fava-dashboards.git
```

Download these ones directly to avoid pulling unnecessary dependencies

```
    git clone https://github.com/tarioch/beancounttools
    git clone https://github.com/Akuukis/beancount_interpolate
    git clone https://github.com/Evernight/beancount-importers.git
```

Run fava on your ledger from the repository folder

```
    PYTHONPATH=PYTHONPATH:. fava main.bean
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and explore Fava.

(optionally) Install additional plugins:

```
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr/fava-portfolio-returns.git
    git clone https://github.com/Akuukis/beancount_share
    git clone https://github.com/Akuukis/beancount_interpolate
```
