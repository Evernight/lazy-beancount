; used for cleaner graphs but we don't want to alter underlying source of truth
; data too much.
; You may choose to disable split plugin in some cases, if you want more precise
; actual data rather than more convenient view on Expenses
plugin "beancount_interpolate.recur"
plugin "beancount_interpolate.split"
